    <H1> CRCL XSD DOCUMENTATION </H1>
    CRCL is an XML robot language for communication
    whose purpose is to standardize robot motion control
    (specifically grasping).  It sits above fieldbus communication
    but below planning level (e.g., PDDL, Redhat Optaplanner -
    two agility planners we use).  CRCL compares to  ROS topics
    (both moveit and joint level) but is more centralized under
    one XSD schema and is more portable (you don't need ROS).

    At NIST, in the NIST Agility lab, we input/integrate PDDL actions controlling
    multiple robot that are translated from PDDL actions (plan level)
    into a CRCL primitive (robot level),
    that is sent to a robot controller (e.g., Fanuc or Motoman servo level).
    <p>
        A breakdown of the CRCL XML schema (XSD) is presented below using XSLT to extract the
        the annotated comments per XSD definition. Below, CRCLCommands and CRCLStatus highlight
        the major command/status areas.

There is also documentation generated by javadoc that is used by the Java CRCL application. It
can be found below.
